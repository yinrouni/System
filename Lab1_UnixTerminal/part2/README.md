# x86-64 Assembly 

> "Nearing Machine Code Representation"

## Introduction/Motivation

Not so long ago (in a galaxy not so far away), programmers wrote most of their code in assembly. While programmers today primarily use higher level languages (Python, C, etc), it is not uncommon to debug the assembly of your code. These higher level languages afterall typically translate down to an assemble or assembly-like language. 

If you are interested in cybersecurity and reverse engineering, folks more frequently write and analyze assembly code. For high performance applications like [games](https://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/169946/CC_low_level_curriculum_Looking_at_optimized_assembly.php), programmers may write very optimized code using assembly to get things *just* right. If you are working in hardware or an embededd device, you might also do some assembly programming, as other languages environments are too bulky to support on a small device. Even web developers are using something called 'webassembly'. Hmm, the list is getting long here--I think the point is that learning assembly has quite some relevance! Let's dig in and get some practice.

In today's lab you are going to get some practice looking at assembly.

# Part 0 - Godbolt

I **strongly** recommend using the godbolt tool (https://godbolt.org/) to write and experiment with your C programs for this exercise.  The color mappings will help you see what is going on with the generated assembly. You **should** try using both godbolt and your compiler to generate assembly.

Here is an example of the Godbolt tool (and also shows part 4 of this lab)

# Part 1- Compiler Generated Assembly

Let us get some experience reading assembly code generated by the compiler (or godbolt)! It is actually kind of fun, you may learn some new instructions, and at the very least gain some intuition for what code the compiler is generating.

## Compiler generated assembly 1 - Swap

- Write a C program that swaps two integers(in the main body of code).
  - Save, Compile, and Run the program to verify it works.
- Output the assembly from that program (Save it as swap_int.s).
  - Use: `gcc -O0 -fno-builtin swap_int.c -S -o swap_int.s`
- Now modify your program to swap two long's.
  - Save, Compile, and Run the program to verify it works.
- Output the assembly from that program (Save it as swap_long.s).
  - Use: `gcc -O0 -fno-builtin swap_long.c -S -o swap_long.s`
- Compare each of the two assembly files using diff. See what changed.
- diff syntax
  - Use: `diff -y swap_int.s swap_long.s`
  
### Response/Observations

- The suffix of mov: movl in swap_int; movq in swap_long.
- Memory size for variable: 4 bytes memory for an integer in swap_int; 8 bytes memory for a long in swap_long.
- Registers: %eax in swap_int; %rax in swap_long.

## Compiler generated assembly 2 - Functions

- Write a C program that swaps two integers in a **function** (You may use today's slide as a reference)
  - Save, Compile, and Run the program to verify it works.
- Output the assembly from that program (Save it as swap.s).
  - Use: `gcc -O0 -fno-builtin  swap.c -S -o swap.s`
- Do the instructions use memory/registers in a different way?

### Response/Observations

- The instructions use memory/registers with parentheses like movl    %edx, (%rax), movl    (%rax), %eax.

## Compiler generated assembly 3 - Static Array
- Write a C program called array.c that has an array of 400 integers in the function of main.
  - Initialize some of the values to something (do not use a loop) (e.g. myArray[0]=72; myArray[70]=56; etc)
  	- Note that it is helpful to use 'weird' numbers so you can see where they jump out.
  - Save, Compile, and Run the program to verify it works.
- Output the assembly from that program (Save it as array.s).
  - Use: `gcc -O0 -fno-builtin  array.c -S -o array.s`
- How much are the offsets from the address?

### Response/Observations

- size of integer(4 bytes) * the index

## Compiler generated assembly 4 - Dynamic Array 

- Write a C program called array2.c that has an array of 400 integers in the function of main that is dynamically allocated.
  - Initialize some of the values to something (do not use a loop) (e.g. myArray[66]=712; myArray[70]=536; etc)
  - Save, Compile, and Run the program to verify it works.
- Output the assembly from that program (Save it as array2.s).
  - Use: `gcc -O0 -fno-builtin  array2.c -S -o array2.s`
- Study the assembly and think about what is different from the static array.

### Response/Observations

- In dynamic array:
  - When visiting array[n], the relative different of address(size of integer * (n - m)) will be aded to the address(array[m]) held in the register.
- In static array:
  - When visiting array[n], go to its address directly.

## Compiler generated assembly 5 - Goto
The C programming language has a 'goto' command, search how to use it if you have not previously.

- Write a C program using the goto command and a label.
  - Save, Compile, and Run the program to verify it works.
- Output the assembly from that program (Save it as goto.s).
  - Use: `gcc -O0 -fno-builtin  goto.c -S -o goto.s`
- Observe what kind of jmp statement is inserted.

### Response/Observations

- jmp (unconditional) and je (jump if equals to 0).

## Compiler generated assembly 6 - For-loops
- Write a C program using a for-loop that counts to 5.
  - Save, Compile, and Run the program to verify it works.
- Output the assembly from that program (Save it as for.s).
  - Use: `gcc -O0 -fno-builtin  for.c -S -o for.s`
- Observe where the code goes for the condition statement (at the start or at the end?).

### Response/Observations

- At the end.

## Compiler generated assembly 7 - Switch Statements

- Write a C program using a switch statement (Sample here)[https://www.tutorialspoint.com/cprogramming/switch_statement_in_c.htm].
  - Save, Compile, and Run the program to verify it works.
- Output the assembly from that program (Save it as switch.s).
  - Use: `gcc -O0 -fno-builtin switch.c -S -o switch.s`
- See what code a switch statement generates. Is it optimal?

### Response/Observations

- A switch statement generates a binary search. It is optimal.

## Compiler generated assembly 8 - Add Function

- Write a C program that calls an add function(long add(long a, long b).
  - Save, Compile, and Run the program to verify it works.
- Output the assembly from that program (Save it as add.s).
  - Use: `gcc -O0 -fno-builtin add.c -S -o add.s`
- Observe the outputs
- Observe arguments put into registers
- Observe where 'popq' is called.

### Response/Observations

- At the end of the function add.

# Deliverable

- For part 1, add your .S files that you have generated to this repository.
  - Note this submission will be auto graded for completion (i.e. save the file names as shown).
  - Add your observations in the appropriate response/observations section for each code.

# Going Further

- (Optional) Try the objdump example to read the disassembly from your programs executables. Observe how close the output is to the compiler generated output.
