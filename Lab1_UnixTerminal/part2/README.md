# x86-64 Assembly 

> "Nearing Machine Code Representation"

## Introduction/Motivation

Not so long ago (in a galaxy not so far away), programmers wrote most of their code in assembly. While programmers today primarily use higher level languages (Python, C, etc), it is not uncommon to debug the assembly of your code. These higher level languages afterall typically translate down to an assemble or assembly-like language. 

If you are interested in cybersecurity and reverse engineering, folks more frequently write and analyze assembly code. For high performance applications like [games](https://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/169946/CC_low_level_curriculum_Looking_at_optimized_assembly.php), programmers may write very optimized code using assembly to get things *just* right. If you are working in hardware or an embededd device, you might also do some assembly programming, as other languages environments are too bulky to support on a small device. Even web developers are using something called 'webassembly'. Hmm, the list is getting long here--I think the point is that learning assembly has quite some relevance! Let's dig in and get some practice.

In today's lab you are going to get some practice looking at assembly.

# Part 0 - Godbolt

I **strongly** recommend using the godbolt tool (https://godbolt.org/) to write and experiment with your C programs for this exercise.  The color mappings will help you see what is going on with the generated assembly. You **should** try using both godbolt and your compiler to generate assembly.

Here is an example of the Godbolt tool (and also shows part 4 of this lab)

# Part 1- Compiler Generated Assembly

Let us get some experience reading assembly code generated by the compiler (or godbolt)! It is actually kind of fun, you may learn some new instructions, and at the very least gain some intuition for what code the compiler is generating.

## Compiler generated assembly 1 - Swap

- Write a C program that swaps two integers(in the main body of code).
  - Save, Compile, and Run the program to verify it works.
- Output the assembly from that program (Save it as swap_int.s).
  - Use: `gcc -O0 -fno-builtin swap_int.c -S -o swap_int.s`
- Now modify your program to swap two long's.
  - Save, Compile, and Run the program to verify it works.
- Output the assembly from that program (Save it as swap_long.s).
  - Use: `gcc -O0 -fno-builtin swap_long.c -S -o swap_long.s`
- Compare each of the two assembly files using diff. See what changed.
- diff syntax
  - Use: `diff -y swap_int.s swap_long.s`
  
### Response/Observations

- The suffix of mov: movl in swap_int; movq in swap_long.
- Memory size for variable: 4 bytes for integer in swap_int; 8 bytes for long in swap_long.
- Registers: %eax in swap_int; %rax in swap_long.
- For swap_int, the mov instruction has an l appended to it, indicating that a double word is being moved. For swap_long, the mov instruction has a q appended to it, indicating that a quad word is being moved. Otherwise, the two assembly files look the same.
## Compiler generated assembly 2 - Functions

- Write a C program that swaps two integers in a **function** (You may use today's slide as a reference)
  - Save, Compile, and Run the program to verify it works.
- Output the assembly from that program (Save it as swap.s).
  - Use: `gcc -O0 -fno-builtin  swap.c -S -o swap.s`
- Do the instructions use memory/registers in a different way?

### Response/Observations
- Once we've created a swap function, the instructions utilize registers that are reserved for special use. Specifically, swap uses %rdi and %rsi, for the first and second parameters for the function. These registers are the pointers to the integers that we want to swap.
- In order to dereference, we now see parentheses (e.g. movl %edx, (%rax))

## Compiler generated assembly 3 - Static Array
- Write a C program called array.c that has an array of 400 integers in the function of main.
  - Initialize some of the values to something (do not use a loop) (e.g. myArray[0]=72; myArray[70]=56; etc)
  	- Note that it is helpful to use 'weird' numbers so you can see where they jump out.
  - Save, Compile, and Run the program to verify it works.
- Output the assembly from that program (Save it as array.s).
  - Use: `gcc -O0 -fno-builtin  array.c -S -o array.s`
- How much are the offsets from the address?

### Response/Observations

- In order to calculate the offset from the address, calculate (size of integer (4 bytes) * the index). If you add this to the pointer to the array (address), you will get the pointer (address) to the specified integer.The pointer for the array should be the address of the first element.
- 400 integers requires 1600 bits of space in memory (4 x 400) The offset from the address at position 0 is 0, at 70 is 280. In the movl instructions, you can see that 73 is moved -1600, 56 is moved -1320. If you calculate the difference between the starting offset (at position 0, or -1600) and the addresses of the integers at position i, you will see that it is offset by 4 x i.


## Compiler generated assembly 4 - Dynamic Array 

- Write a C program called array2.c that has an array of 400 integers in the function of main that is dynamically allocated.
  - Initialize some of the values to something (do not use a loop) (e.g. myArray[66]=712; myArray[70]=536; etc)
  - Save, Compile, and Run the program to verify it works.
- Output the assembly from that program (Save it as array2.s).
  - Use: `gcc -O0 -fno-builtin  array2.c -S -o array2.s`
- Study the assembly and think about what is different from the static array.

### Response/Observations

- Because you are allocating memory to the heap, the dynamic array in assembly looks different from the static array in assembly. 
- Dynamic Arrays: The integers are assigned dynamically to a temporary and then stored in the heap.
- Not that in the dynamic array, there is an addq/subq to update the pointer depending on the position at which the integer is to be added (after the initial position of 0). Then you dereference the pointer, adding the relevant integer. Then you move back to the initial position of 0, and continue for each added integer.
- Static Arrays: The integers are directly assigned to a register, and stored locally.
## Compiler generated assembly 5 - Goto
The C programming language has a 'goto' command, search how to use it if you have not previously.

- Write a C program using the goto command and a label.
  - Save, Compile, and Run the program to verify it works.
- Output the assembly from that program (Save it as goto.s).
  - Use: `gcc -O0 -fno-builtin  goto.c -S -o goto.s`
- Observe what kind of jmp statement is inserted.

### Response/Observations

- jmp (unconditional) and je (jump if equals to 0).

## Compiler generated assembly 6 - For-loops
- Write a C program using a for-loop that counts to 5.
  - Save, Compile, and Run the program to verify it works.
- Output the assembly from that program (Save it as for.s).
  - Use: `gcc -O0 -fno-builtin  for.c -S -o for.s`
- Observe where the code goes for the condition statement (at the start or at the end?).

### Response/Observations

- It is At the end in the code. But it happens at the beginning. You can see that after initializing i, there is an instruction to jump to .L2. If condition is met, then jump to the body of the loop (jle .L3). Otherwise, there is an instruction to leave, which means that the body of the loop isn't executed.

## Compiler generated assembly 7 - Switch Statements

- Write a C program using a switch statement (Sample here)[https://www.tutorialspoint.com/cprogramming/switch_statement_in_c.htm].
  - Save, Compile, and Run the program to verify it works.
- Output the assembly from that program (Save it as switch.s).
  - Use: `gcc -O0 -fno-builtin switch.c -S -o switch.s`
- See what code a switch statement generates. Is it optimal?

### Response/Observations

- A switch statement generates conditional codes and branches. This is relatively optimal, because once the condition in a switch is met, it breaks. This means that you only need to go into the branch if the condition is met. This is more optimal from a time efficiency standpoint.

## Compiler generated assembly 8 - Add Function

- Write a C program that calls an add function(long add(long a, long b).
  - Save, Compile, and Run the program to verify it works.
- Output the assembly from that program (Save it as add.s).
  - Use: `gcc -O0 -fno-builtin add.c -S -o add.s`
- Observe the outputs
- Observe arguments put into registers
- Observe where 'popq' is called.

### Response/Observations

- At the end of the function add. The arguments put into the registers are the memory addresses of the longs.

# Deliverable

- For part 1, add your .S files that you have generated to this repository.
  - Note this submission will be auto graded for completion (i.e. save the file names as shown).
  - Add your observations in the appropriate response/observations section for each code.

# Going Further

- (Optional) Try the objdump example to read the disassembly from your programs executables. Observe how close the output is to the compiler generated output.
